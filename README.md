Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description 

This Portfolio Project showcases my skills and talents in the development of web applications. it starts with information about me, and links to direct the user towards my work and my contact details. Users can see my work clicking on the Take Me There Button placed at the bottom left of the web applications cards, which will taken them to that deployed application. In this portfolio project I have made use of Bootstrap navigation bar, layout grid and Jumbotron components to create the structure of the web application and to make its layout responsive so it adapts to varios screens and devices.
